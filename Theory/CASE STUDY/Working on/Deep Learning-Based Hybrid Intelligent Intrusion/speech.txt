Good Morning all.
Thank you all for joinng Here Today.
I Ajay Prasad intend to present on the Topic Intelligent intrusion detection system,
titled as "Deep Learning-Based Hybrid Intelligent Intrusion Detection System"
under the guidence of Prof. dr vinod chandra ss.
which focuses on the idea of enhancing intrusion detection through the integration of deep learning techniques.
without further adue, lets get into the Topic.

slide-2 

Cyber security!
as we all know cyber security is one of the hot topics in and around our daily life, as well as in the industry.
its crucial to undertand the evolving nature of cyber threats. with increasing frequency complexity, 
posing risk to individuals, Organizations and Governments.
Examples of common cybersecurity threats include:
Malware: malicious software designed to harm or exploit computer
systems, including viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
Phishing: a type of social engineering attack that uses fraudulent
emails or websites to trick users into revealing sensitive information,
such as passwords or credit card numbers
DDoS attacks: Distributed Denial of Service attacks that flood a
network or website with traffic, causing it to become unavailable to
users.
Other types of cybersecurity threats include ransomware, insider
threats, and advanced persistent threats (APTs).
The consequences of falling victim to these attacks are severe, ranging from 
substantial financial losses to reputational damage and legal liabilities

proactive security measures are essential to ensure detection and action of such threats.

slide-3
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a critical component of
proactive security measures, designed to detect and respond to
malicious activities in a network.
they ARE GENERALLY OF two kinds, Networkbased intrusion detection system and Host based intrusion detection system.
intrusion detection system can be of either software
or as an hardware component. in most of the cases its software.
it can effectively Identify and respond to security incidents in real-time,
Minimize the impact of security breaches, and
Improve overall network security posture.
There are various categories of IDS, including Signature-based Systems (SBS), Anomaly-based Systems (ABS), 
and Stateful Protocol Analysis. Each has its strengths in identifying and responding to different types of threats. 
Importantly, the use of IDS in conjunction with firewalls and antivirus solutions provides a comprehensive security 
strategy.

so how does it functon? the techniques in action.

slide-4
Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) are based on
signature-based or anomaly-based detection techniques.
In the signature-based approach, known attack signatures are used for identification. 
While effective against known threats, this method falls short when dealing with unknown or zero-day attacks. 
Moreover, it often produces high false positive rates, leading to alert fatigue among security personnel.
On the other hand, anomaly-based detection identifies deviations from normal behavior using statistical models. 
However, traditional anomaly-based systems face limitations in scalability and adaptability to 
changing network environments.

Recognizing these shortcomings, there's a clear need for advanced IDS that incorporates machine learning. 
By leveraging machine learning, we can significantly improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives.


slide-5

Traditional ML techniques in intrusion detection systems face
many challenges:
One major limitation lies in their reliance on pre-defined features, which restricts their adaptability 
to dynamic and evolving threats. 
Additionally, there are persistent issues with false positives and false negatives. 
These inaccuracies can lead to both unnecessary alerts and missed detections, 
In high-traffic networks with large data volumes, traditional machine learning may struggle to keep 
pace with the sheer volume of information flowing through. 
This poses a significant challenge to the scalability and efficiency of intrusion detection.
To address these challenges, it becomes evident that we need to explore and implement advanced techniques. 
Deep learning, with its ability to automatically learn relevant features from data, 
emerges as a promising solution to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of intrusion detection systems.

slide-6

we know that  Today, cyber-space is known as the fifth battlespace, following land, air, space, and sea;
cyber warfare can affect the military strategies and activities that are associated with national
security.

Cybersecurity attacks are on the rise, and traditional IDS struggle with
sophisticated attacks.
we aim to overcome limitations
and enhance accuracy and efficiency.

We seek to detect unknown attacks, reduce false positives, and identify various threats that might otherwise go 
unnoticed.
The real-world applications of the study are vast. The outcomes have the potential to significantly 
improve cybersecurity measures,     
protecting valuable data and preventing financial losses. Furthermore, by staying ahead of evolving threats, 
the research can provide invaluable support to Nations and  organizations in fortifying their security postures
In summary, the significance of our study lies in its potential to enhance IDS accuracy, impact 
cybersecurity practices positively, 
and empower organizations in their defense against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.

slide-7
before we further procede i would like to mention some of the possible benefits of using deep learning.
Deep learning algorithms offer several advantages for intrusion
detection:
Unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning has the capacity to learn complex features directly from raw data. 
This eliminates the need for extensive manual feature engineering, a time-consuming process in traditional approaches.
Moreover, deep learning excels in handling high-dimensional data, a common characteristic of network traffic 
information. 
By doing so, it addresses a crucial challenge in intrusion detection and reduces the dependency on manually crafted
 features.
Another noteworthy advantage lies in the ability of deep learning to improve accuracy by detecting subtle patterns 
that may be missed by traditional machine learning approaches. 
This adaptability to intricate patterns is particularly valuable in the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.
Furthermore, deep learning models exhibit a dynamic quality—they adapt to changing traffic patterns by continuously
 learning from new data. 
In our research, we leverage these advantages to demonstrate how deep learning outperforms traditional machine
 learning, 
ultimately enhancing accuracy and effectiveness in the realm of intrusion detection. 
As we delve deeper into the technical aspects of our methodology

In Stage-2, these LSTMAE-based modules play a crucial role. They analyze the preprocessed anomalous traffic from 
Stage-1, 
diving deep into the intricacies of the data. Trained on labeled datasets encompassing various attack types, such 
as DOS, internal infiltrations,DDos, and SSH attacks, 
these modules learn the characteristics of different attacks.
The real magic happens as these modules detect and classify attacks in real-time network traffic. 
Their effectiveness in classifying specific attack types contributes significantly to the improved accuracy and 
efficiency of our 
intrusion detection system. This stage represents a critical component in our Hybrid Intelligent Approach, where 
the strengths of deep 
learning shine in identifying and categorizing specific cyber threats.
